## Topological Sort

### What is topological ordering?
A topological ordering is an ordering of the nodes in a directed graph where for each directed edge from node A to node B, node A appears before node B.

### Some important information
- The topological sort algorithm can find a topological ordering in O(V+E) time!
- Topological orderings are not unique.
- You can do this using another algorithm based on indegree and outdegree.
